Bank Analysis Project
=====================

📌 Project Overview
-------------------
This project was developed as a group work to simulate and analyze banking operations and performance using Power BI.  
Since real banking data is sensitive, we created a synthetic dataset in SQL, then imported and modeled it in Power BI to generate insights and interactive dashboards.

⚙️ Project Workflow
-------------------
1. Data Creation  
   - Designed and populated a fake SQL database to represent customer transactions, loans, and other banking activities.  

2. Data Modeling  
   - Loaded the SQL dataset into Power BI.  
   - Performed data transformations and relationships for accurate reporting.  

3. Visualization & Analysis  
   - Built interactive dashboards to analyze key metrics such as:  
     - Customer transactions  
     - Loan performance  
     - Risk indicators  
     - Department efficiency  

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
------------------------
- SQL → Data generation and storage  
- Power BI → Data visualization and analysis  
- GitHub → Project sharing and version control  

📊 Key Outcomes
---------------
- Practiced end-to-end data analysis workflow (from dataset creation to visualization).  
- Learned how to transform raw data into actionable banking insights.  
- Improved teamwork and reporting skills while working on a realistic group project scenario.
